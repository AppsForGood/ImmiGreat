    <string name="lawsPublicChargePageOverviewStr">Public charge is the law that prevents people who
        are likely to become a government expense from becoming citizens of the United States. The
        expenses which fall under public charge are cash assistance for income maintenance (such as
        SSI and TANF) and institutionalization for long term care. If it is determined that an
        non-citizen either constitutes a public charge or is likely to do so, they will lose their
        eligibility to become a lawful citizen.
